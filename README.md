# PiLights
Code for our RGB light controlling RaspberryPi project, built from the Adafruit tutorial for using Neopixel lights with a RaspberryPi. Ultimate goal is to create a grid of RGB LED's that will get input from a user on a drawing webapp, then display the drawing on the rudimentary screen.


## To-Do List
- Figure out the scale of the grid (total number of LEDs needed)
- Find a suitable power supply option
- Find a solution for getting user drawings
- Write a display function that will take user drawings and translate them to commands for the lights
